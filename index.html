            <p>"Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is celebrated as the "Father
                of Microfinance" for founding the Grameen Bank in 1983. His revolutionary approach of providing small,
                collateral-free loans to the poor, particularly women, empowered millions in Bangladesh to escape
                poverty through self-employment and entrepreneurship. His work not only transformed rural development
                and women's empowerment in Bangladesh but also inspired a global movement for financial inclusion. Dr.
                Yunus also pioneered the concept of social business, emphasizing enterprises that focus on solving
                social issues rather than maximizing profits."</p>
